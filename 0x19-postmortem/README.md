Postmortem: Apache 500 Error Outage
Issue Summary:
Duration: The outage lasted from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM (UTC -5).
Impact: The Apache server experienced a 500 Internal Server Error, causing the WordPress website to be inaccessible. Approximately 80% of users were affected, experiencing either slow loading times or complete unavailability.
Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was a misconfiguration in the WordPress PHP settings file (wp-settings.php), which resulted in Apache returning 500 errors.
Timeline:
10:00 AM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a surge in 500 errors.
10:05 AM: Engineering team initiated investigation, suspecting a server misconfiguration or application error.
10:20 AM: Initial assumption focused on Apache misconfiguration due to recent system updates.
10:40 AM: Misleading investigation path pursued, checking Apache logs for any suspicious entries related to recent updates.
11:00 AM: Issue escalated to senior engineering team as initial investigations yielded no conclusive results.
11:20 AM: Strace tool utilized to trace Apache processes, revealing the misconfiguration in the PHP settings file.
11:30 AM: Issue resolved by correcting the misconfiguration in the PHP settings file.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The issue stemmed from a misconfiguration in the WordPress PHP settings file (wp-settings.php). Specifically, the PHP handler was incorrectly defined, leading Apache to return 500 errors.
Resolution: The issue was fixed by using Puppet to automate the correction of the misconfiguration in the PHP settings file. A Puppet manifest (0-strace_is_your_friend.pp) was created to execute a command (sed) to replace the incorrect PHP handler with the correct one.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Regular audits of server configurations to catch similar misconfigurations before they impact service.
Implementation of automated configuration management tools like Puppet to ensure consistency across server environments.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Implement stricter configuration validation checks to prevent similar misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring to immediately detect and alert on 500 errors and other critical server issues.
Conduct a comprehensive review of all server configurations to identify and rectify any potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
Schedule regular training sessions for engineering teams to enhance troubleshooting skills and familiarize them with debugging tools like strace.
